# Rotation and Graduate Students
This document lists the expectations for students joining my lab.  Some content is borrowed from: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005709

# What you can expect from me
* I am committed to mentoring you now and in the future. This will be geared towards the future career that you want, be it in industry, government, academic, etc.  I am committed to your education and training while in my group, and to advising and guiding your career development. I will work to promote you and your work.
* I will be available for regular meetings and will provide timely review of research. In addition, I will do my best to provide an open door policy and respond quickly to e-mails and Slack messages.  Please be aware that there will be times when I will be unavailable due to other obligations. For abstracts and small data questions, I will generally be able to review in 1-2 days, for papers and thesis, I will need 1-2 weeks. In the event of a lab emergency, I may be contacted on my cell phone.
* I will provide a work environment that is intellectually stimulating, inclusive, supportive, safe, and free from harassment. I take seriously any difficulties you experience in relationship to this statement – if there are conflicts with another group member, please inform me and I will work with you and the other group member to find a resolution. I will strive to understand your unique situation and am open to your suggestions on how to improve your experience in the lab.
* I will work with you on your professional development.  This includes public speaking, scientific writing, best practices for code and data management, expanding your professional network, and technical skills development.

# What I expect from you
* You will need to determine the requirements for your individual graduate program and are responsible for insuring that you are in compliance. As you progress, I will work with you to select courses, qualifying exams, and committee members.
* You will keep me updated on your research progress and challenges.
* To earn your degree you must transition towards independence. We will work together to track this process, but ultimately when you earn a degree will be up to the work you produce, not simply the time you put in. 
* Seek out additional professional development opportunities – being a successful scientist involves more than being good at the computer/bench. You must communicate well (presentations, papers, grants), develop personal skills (time and project management, mentoring), maintain high ethical standards, and for a faculty career, teach. However, these opportunities must be balanced with the most important element of your career development – research progress towards your thesis. 
* You will spend at least 20 hours per week in my research group
* You will meet people working my research group, Data Science Institute, CyVerse, and Digital Agriculture
* You will ask for help when you need it
* You will contribute towards an inclusive, supportive, and diverse research environment

# You will develop your technical and research skills
* You will learn the following base-level computational skills: 
  * Linux command line
  * i-commands
  * Logging into remote servers
  * Launching and using Jupyter Notebooks
  * Running bioinformatic tools
  * Have introductary skills in programming (Python/R/shell)
  * Best practices for managing code and data
  * Git / GitHub
  * Containers: Docker, Singulatiry, and DockerHub

# Before you start, you will have:
* Complete this assessment: https://github.com/elyons/Joining_the_group/blob/master/Questionnaire-for-new-students.md
* Read these papers:
  * Best Practices for Scientific Computing: https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745
  * Good Enough Practices for Scientific Computing: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510
* Set up the following accounts:
  * CyVerse: https://user.cyverse.org
  * UA HPC: https://account.arizona.edu/welcome
  * GitHub: https://github.com/
  * DockerHub: https://hub.docker.com/
  * Building access to BSRL: https://access.bio5.org/
* Gone through the following tutorials:
  * CyVerse's Foundation of Open Science Skills tutorials available: https://cyverse-foss-2020.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html
  * Software essential tutorials available: https://cyverse-foss-2020.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html

# While a member of my group, you will contribute to being a good citizen
* You will help and teach others
* You will share your data and analyses with others (these belong to the group, not to any single individual)
* You will foster a culture of inclusivity, professional respect, support, and sharing
* You will document what you do so others can reproduce it
* You will keep your work and documentation open for others to use and reference (we leverage the open source/open science communities and will contribute back to support others)
* You will be respectful, tolerant, and collegial with your colleagues.
